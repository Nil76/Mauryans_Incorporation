							Plastic Injection Molding 
						</h3> 
						<p class="small-para"> 
							Plastic injection molding is a widely used manufacturing process for producing plastic parts in large volumes. It involves injecting molten plastic material into a mold, where it cools and solidifies into the final shape. Here’s a detailed overview of the process:
						</p> 
						<p class="small-para"> 
							Clamping:

The mold consists of two halves, the injection mold (A-side) and the ejector mold (B-side). A clamping unit holds the mold halves together under pressure. <br><br><br>
Injection:

Plastic pellets are fed into a hopper and then melted in a heated barrel. The molten plastic is injected into the mold cavity through a nozzle using a screw or plunger. <br><br><br>
Cooling:

Once the mold is filled, the plastic is allowed to cool and solidify. Cooling time depends on the material and the thickness of the part. <br><br><br>
Ejection:

After the part has cooled, the mold opens, and the ejection system pushes the finished part out of the mold. <br><br><br>
Post-Processing:

Parts may undergo additional processes like trimming, painting, or assembly to meet specific requirements.

						<p class="small-para"> 
							CNC (Computer Numerical Control) programming is the process of creating a set of instructions for CNC machines to follow in order to perform various machining tasks such as cutting, drilling, milling, and turning. These machines use computer-generated code to control the movement and operation of machine tools. Here’s an overview of CNC programming:
						</p> 
						<p class="small-para"> 
							G-Code and M-Code: <br><br><br><br>

G-Code: The language used to instruct the machine on how to move. It includes commands for motion, positioning, and toolpath definitions.
M-Code: Miscellaneous functions that control machine operations such as coolant flow, spindle speed, and tool changes. <br><br><br><br><br>
CNC Program Structure:

Programs are typically written in a series of blocks or lines, with each line containing a command or instruction.

							3D Printing 
						</h3> 
						<p class="small-para"> 
							3D printing, also known as additive manufacturing, is a process of creating three-dimensional objects from a digital file by layering materials until the object is formed. Here’s a detailed overview of 3D printing:
						</p> 
						<p class="small-para"> 
							Creating a 3D Model: <br>

Design the object using CAD (Computer-Aided Design) software or download a pre-made design from online repositories. <br><br><br>
Slicing: <br>

The 3D model is converted into a series of thin, horizontal layers using slicing software. This generates a G-code file that instructs the printer on how to create each layer. <br><br><br>
Printing: <br>

The 3D printer follows the G-code instructions to deposit material layer by layer, building the object from the bottom up. <br><br><br>
Post-Processing: <br>

After printing, the object may require post-processing steps such as removing support structures, sanding, or painting. <br><br><br>
